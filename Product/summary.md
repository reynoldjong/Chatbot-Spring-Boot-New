# C01 Project - Summary

## Objective

This project seeks to build a chatbot web application that will run on DFI's webpage. To the user, this 
chatbot will appear on the corner of the webpage as a small chat window. Most prominently, the user will 
be greeted by the chatbot when the webpage is initially loaded. The user can then ask the chatbot 
questions through entering it in the chat window. The chatbot can then parse the user's query and then 
reply to the user with webpages that best reflect the user's query. Additionally, the chatbot will also 
have a feature that allows a registered administrator the ability to modify what results can appear in a 
user's query.

## Key Users

Adam - a 25 year old intern of DFI, is tasked to be an administrator of the chatbot application. He is 
familiar with technology but is afraid of making big mistakes that may cost him his job.

Bob - a 58 year old senior financial analyst working for CIBC. He is researching on what technology he 
can bring to his company and came across the DFI webpage. He wishes to use the chatbot to help him 
quickly gather useful information on DFI so he can write a report to his manager.

Charlie - a 35 year old founder of an e-commerce website called dBay wishes to expand his business by 
looking at the technology solutions that DFI has to offer. He hopes that the chatbot can navigate him 
to the right information that can help him grow his business.

## Key Scenarios

Adam is asked to update some documents on the company's chatbot. He needs to upload the new documents 
and also to remove the old ones to keep things up to date.

Bob has stumbled upon the DFI webpage as he research financial technologies. He notice a small chat 
window pop up near the bottom right of the webpage when he was greeted by the chatbot. He wishes to 
ask the chatbot for information on DFI.

Charlie wishes to grow his business and has come across the DFI webpage. At first, he closed the chatbot 
window thinking that he did not need help. However, after navigating the website for a while he figures 
that his time would be better spent if he asked the chatbot for help instead.

## Key Principles

User friendly and intuitive - The design should provide users an easy to learn interface. It should not 
slow down any site visitors.

Welcoming and pleasing - The design should not be intrusive to the user experience. It should give site 
visitors an option to use or ignore it.
